# ham-git

This repository is a bit tongue-in-cheek, a bit practice with bash: the objective is to represent commands commonly used in Git
with lyrics from the hit Broadway musical _Hamilton_. Each file is a simple bash script that converts a lyric from the musical
into a Git command.

To install, clone the repository, and simply run 
```chmod +x *```
to make every file in the repository executable. Then add the repository to your ```PATH``` in your local ```~/.bash_profile```.

Commands represented: \
```git init``` = ```experiment begins```\
```git clone``` = ```angelica eliza peggy```\
```git add``` = ```un deux trois```\
```git rm``` = ```sept huit neuf```\
```git config``` = ```my name is```\
```git pull``` = ```keep your flame```\
```git push``` = ```paces fire```\
```git commit``` = ```get the job done```\
```git reset``` = ```burn```\
```git fetch``` = ```come downstairs```\
```git grep``` = ```follow the money and see where it goes```\
```git rebase``` = ```iwill kill your friends and family```\
```git merge``` = ```world was wide enough```\
```git checkout``` = ```iam not throwing away my shot```\
```git branch``` = ```meet your son```\
```git remote``` = ```ocean away```\
```git log``` = ```record of every check```\
```git status``` = ```tell your story```\
```git diff``` = ```show what they up against```\
```git stash``` = ```just you wait```\
```git tag``` = ```aim no higher```

Command arguments work exactly the same as in the original commands. For example, to clone this repository, you could 
type ```angelica eliza peggy https://github.com/teddyterminal/ham-git.git```.
